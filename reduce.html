            <strong>There are a lot of simple ways that you can shrink your carbon footprint. Check how
                many of them you are doing now!</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose fruits and vegetables in season. Transporting food from other countries or
                    regions by trucks, ships and planes uses a huge amount of fossil fuels, which
                    increases your carbon footprint.
                </li>
                <li>Only buy the amount of food that you are able to finish before the expiry date. Try to
                    avoid food wastage.
                </li>
                <li>Carry your own bags when shopping and try to avoid using plastic bags. Better
                    alternatives could be paper bags, canvas bags, jute bags, cotton bags, etc.
                </li>
                <li>Walk more and drive less. When your destination is not far away, walking or cycling are
                    much better than driving. They not only reduce CO2 emissions, they
                    help you maintain a healthy body.
                </li>
                </p>
                <li>If you cannot avoid driving a car, consider buying an electric car. Electric cars
                    produce significantly less CO2 than petrol-powered cars, meaning that they are more
                    environmentally friendly. It does not have to be as expensive as a Tesla, there are a lot
                    more options now and the prices are decreasing.
                </li>
                </p>
                <li>Switch lights off when you leave your room and unplug your electronic devices when they
                    are not in use.
                </li>
            </ul>

                planet.</p>
