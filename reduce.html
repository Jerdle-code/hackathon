    <h1><strong>Reduce CO2 Emissions</strong></h1>

    <p><h2>There are a lot of simple ways that you can do to shrink your carbon footprint. Check how many of them you are doing now!</h2></p>
    <p><li>Choose fruits and vegetables in season. Transporting food from other countries or regions by vehicles, ships and planes uses huge amount of fossil fuels, and that will increase the carbon emissions.</li></p>
    <p><li>Only buy the amount of food that you are able to finish before the expiry day, try to avoid food wastage.</li></p>
    <p><li>Carry your own bags when shopping and try to avoid using plastic bags. Better alternatives could be paper bags, canvas bags, jute bags, cotton bags, etc.</li></p>
    <p><li>Walk more and drive less. When your destination is not far away, walking or cycling are much better ways than driving, because they can not only reduce CO2 emissions, but also help you maintain a healthy body.</li></p>
    <p><li>If you cannot avoid driving a car, consider buying an electric car. Electric cars produce significantly less CO2 than gas-powered cars, meaning that they are more environmentally friendly. It does not have to be as expensive as Tesla, there are a lot more options now and the prices are decreasing.</li></p>
    <p><li>Switch lights off when you leave your room and unplug your electronic devices when they are not in use.</li></p>
