                        <h4>Climate Change</h4>
                        <h5>Causes:</h5>
                        <p>The main driver of climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). One of the main
                            GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere is carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). That is why it is so
                            important to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
                        <h5>Effects:</h5>
                        <p>Temperatures in the Arctic are rising. As a result, polar ice caps and glaciers are melting,
                            making it extremely difficult for polar bears to find food.</p>
                        <p>Have you noticed that extreme weather events occur more frequently nowadays? That is also
                            related to climate change. In 2020, 13 hurricanes have hit the North Atlantic, 6 of them
                            major. Those have led to a total death toll of over 431 people and a total damage of around
                            $51 billion.</p>

                        <h4>Pollution</h4>
                        <h5>Causes:</h5>
                        <p>Pollution can be natural, such as volcanic ash. But it can also be caused by human
                            activities, such as car exhaust and industrial discharge.</p>
                        <h5>Effects:</h5>
                        <p>Pollution causes around 7 million premature deaths every year resulting from long-term health
                            problems such as lung cancer, respiratory diseases, heart diseases, etc. According to WHO,
                            "9 out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits containing high levels of
                            pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures."</p>

                        <h4>Waste</h4>
                        <h5>Plastic:</h5>
                        <p>Plastic products such as plastic bags and cups release toxic chemicals into the soil and
                            damage the environment. Sadly, 100,000 marine animals are killed by waste plastic products
                            every year. One in three sea turtles have been found with plastic in their stomachs.</p>
                        <h5>Water</h5>
                        <p>Water waste is another major issue. Since water takes a long process to be filtered and
                            cleaned to become drinkable, we now have much less usable water left on the planet.
                            According to WHO, more than 3.4 million people die each year from waterborne diseases, and
                            this kind of disease is caused by filthy water.</p>
                        <h5>Paper</h5>
                        <p>93% of paper comes from trees, and trees release oxygen through the process of
                            photosynthesis. Approximately 1 billion trees worth of paper (1.85 million tons) are thrown
                            away every year in the U.S alone.</p>
