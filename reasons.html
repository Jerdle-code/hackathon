    <p><h2><strong>Climate Change</strong></h2></p>
    <li>Causes:</li>   
    <p>The main driver of the climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), one of the main GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere is carbon disoxide (CO2). That is why it is so important to reduce CO2 emissions.</p>
    <li>Effects:</li>
    <p>Tempreatures in the Artic are rising, as a result, polar ice caps and glaciers are melting, causing it extremely difficult for polar bears to find food.</p>

    <p>Have you noticed that extrem weather events occur more frequently nowadays? That is also related to climate change. In 2020, 13 hurricanes have crunched the North Atlantic where 6 of them are major hurricanes. Those have led to a total fatility of over 431 people and a total damage of around $51 billion.</p>

    <p><h2><strong>Pollution</strong></h2></p>
    <li>Causes:</li>
    <p>Pollutions can be natural, such as volcanic ash. But it can also be caused by human activities, such as car exhaust and industrial discharge.</p>
    <li>Effects:</li>
    <p>Pollution has caused around 7 million premature deaths every year resulting from long-term health problems such as lung cancer, respiratory diseases, heart diseases, etc. According to WHO, "9 out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds WHO guidline limits containing high levels of pollutants, whih low- and midlle-inceom countries suffering from the highest exposures."</p>

    <p><h2><strong>Waste</strong></h2></p>
    <li>Plastic:</li>
    <p>Plastic products such as plastic bags and cups release toxic chemicals into the soil and damage the environment. Sadly, 100,000 marine animals are killed by wasted plastic products every year. One in three sea turtles have been found with plastic in their stomachs.</p>

    <li>Water</li>
    <p>Water waste is another major issue. Since water takes a long process to be filtered and cleaned to become drinkable. We now have much less usable water left on the planet. According to WHO, more than 3.4 million people die each year from waterborne diseases, and this kind of disease is caused by filthy water.</p>
    <li>Paper</li>
    <p>93& of paper comes from trees, and trees release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. There are approximately 1 billino trees worth of paper are thrown away every year in the U.S, and 1.85 million tons of paper waste is created each year.</p>
